# Disease Prediction Model using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning-based model designed to predict the likelihood of a person contracting or being diagnosed with a particular disease. The model leverages various machine learning algorithms and techniques to process relevant data, identify patterns, and make accurate predictions.

# Features:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights
- Model training using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Neural Networks (can be customized)
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualizations to showcase important features and model performance
- Jupyter notebooks for easy experimentation

# Technologies:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive exploration)

# How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.

# Dataset:
